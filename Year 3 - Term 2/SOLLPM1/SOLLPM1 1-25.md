People are central to PRINCE2 method, purpose of project is to deliver change and what affect business as usual BAU

## 10 Reasons Why People Resist Change

1. **Loss of Job Security or Control** - Fear they may lose their jobs orr not have input into how their job is done. 
2. **Shock and Fear of the Unknown** - People will usually move forward if they feel the risk of standing still outweighs the risk of moving forward. Change should be communicated early and convincing
3. **Lack of Confidence** - They fear they will not be able to learn new systems / processes to perform to their best ability. Upskilling. Management should help employees built competencies to increase confidence.
4. **Poor Timing** - Too much change, all at once can cause employee resistance. People should feel the benefits of previous change efforts to help buy in to the next change.
5. **Lack of Rewards** - Employees will resist change they do not see anything in it for them in terms of rewards. Management need to explain the tangible short-term and long term benefits
6. Office Politics - Some employees resist change to prove to management that the decision is wrong or that the person leading the change is not capable of this initiative. Others may resist change because they may lose power in the organizational structure. 
7. Loss of Support System - Employees get ccomfortable with who they work with, their team and managers to have built a predictable support system. Human nature to avoid the unfamiliar, but on the other hand, most people enjoy adventure. Management communicates how the new support system will work. 
8. Former Change Experience - If employees experienced poor change managemenet in the past, they tend to resist new changes even more. Management talk about previous change initiative and highlight benefits.
9. Lack of Trust and Support - Change doesn't happen well in an atmosphere of distrust. Communication must be and actions must be trustworthy for employees to build faith in the intentions of management
10. Peer Pressure - organizational stakeholders will resist change to protect the interest of a group. People are willing to hange if the promise of the future is better than the realities of the present.

## ADKAR Model

Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability and Reinforcement

Step 1: Awareness
- Identifies why change is necessary
- Launching project and whatever, need to first implement awareness (Kickoff, Walkthrough, Convention)

Step 2: Desire
- Once people know WHY the change is necessay, they need to desire to be part of and support the change

Step 3: Knowledge
- People need to understand the change. This includes understaanding new processes and systems in addition to new roles and responsibilities. Knowledge can be imparted through training and education.

Step 4: Ability 
- Knowledge is supported with hands on practice and access to expertise and help as needed. 

Step 5: Reinforcement
- Supports the sustainment of the change. This can include rewards, recognition feedback and measurement.
