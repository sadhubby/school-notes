# PRINCE2 Principles

1. ensure continued business justification
	- need sufficient business justification to **warrant investment** to initiate the project and ongoing investment through to successful completion.
	- If not enough business justification, it must be stopped
	- Those driven by legislation or regulation still require **justification for the chosen approach**
	- business justification for a project may change.
	- can approve negative NPV if with qualitative positives besides quantitative approach (the npv itself whether its positive or negative)
1. learn from experience
	- actively seeks, records and implements improvements as result of relevant lessons.
	- documentations
2.  define roles, responsibilities and relationships
3.  manage by stages
	- planned monitored and controlled on stage by stage basis
	- Stage - section of a project that the project manager is managing on behalf pf project board
	- Stage gate - synonymous to sprint planning.
4. manage by exception
   - PRINCE2 establishes limits of delegated authority by defining tolerances
   - tolerance - permissible deviation
   - seven aspects of tolerance
	   - benefits
	   - cost
	   - time
	   - quality
	   - scope
	   - sustainability
	   - risk
	- implementation of manage by exception provides for efficient use of senior management time
1. focus on products
	- helps manage scope creep
2. tailor to suit the project
	- tailor to suit size complexity
	- project manager is responsible for tailoring and will make recommendations having consulted relevant lessons and standards
	- project initiation documentation.
