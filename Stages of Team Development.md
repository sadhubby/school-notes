Team effectiveness is enhanced by a team's commitment to reflection and on-going evaluation

Teams go through stages of development. The most commonly used framework for a team's stages of development was developed in the mid-1960s by Bruce W. Tuckman.

_Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing_

Each stage of team development has its own recognizable feelings and behaviors; understanding _why_ things are happening in certain ways
