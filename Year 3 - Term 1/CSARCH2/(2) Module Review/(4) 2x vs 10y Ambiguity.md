2^10 bytes = 1024 bytes = 1 kibibyte (KiB)
10^3 bytes = 1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)

- The prefix kilo means 1000 in SI definition and this causes some confusion and conflict
- 1998, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) established the binary prefix *kibi* (KiB) to mean 1024

## 2^x vs 10^y ambiguity

- Larger unit of binary prefixes:

*Table of SI and Binary*
- Binary prefix has a larger value than SI prefix

- Binary prefixes (2^x) ; mainly for memory capacity
- SI prefixes (10^y): mainly for data transfer rate or storage space

> [!NOTE]
> SI prefix is 10^y where y are multiples of 3 ; Binary prefix is 2^x where x are multiples of 10
