Com Architecture involves computer design based on aspects:
- Instruction Set Architecture
- Organization or Microarchitecture
- Hardware Implementation

**Issues involving Com Architecture**
- representation of data types - i.e., is integer defined as 32-bit or 64-bit
- Class of ISA - load-store or register-memory architecture
- instruction set - whether to support MUL or not
- Memory addressing - byte-size? how about endianness?
- addressing modes 

**Instruction set architecture**
- Assembly language

**Computer Organization**
- refers to the term "microarchitecture"
- Some issues:
	- arithmetic unit - sequential circuit binary multiplier
	- control signals
	- cache memory

**Hardware Implementation**
- refers to the specific of a computer
	- logic design
		- combinational circuit
		- sequential circuit
	- packaging technology of a computer

**Von Neumann Architecture**
- you already know this but here's some more definitions
- **Store Program Architecture**
	- program and data are stored in the main memory and NOT in the CPU
	- Instructions in the main memory are: **Fetched, Decoded and Executed** sequentially

### The Technology

- Vacuum Tubes
	- Dr. Lee De Forest, 1906
	- Used by computers late 30's early 40's
	- Mainframe: ENIAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC1
- Transistor
	- William Shockley, John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain. 1947 in BELL LABS
	- Used by computers: 1957
	- Minicomputer: DEC PDP (TX-0) IBM 7090 series, IBM 1401
- Integrated Circuit
	- Jack S. Kilby ITI), Robert S. Noyce (Fairchild), 1958
	- Used by computers: 1964
	- DEC PDP-8, System/360
	- Speed War and finding who is the fastest
- VLSI & Microprocessor
	- Marcian E. "Ted" Hoff Jr, 1971
	- Industry's 1st microprocessor: Intel 4004
	- Used in the early 70's
	- Microcomputers
	- Instead of speed war, it became a feature war (i.e., 6 cores, dual-cores, unlocked)
- Micron (mew)
	- Micrometer or one millionth of a meter
	- Strand of human hair is about 100 mew wide
- Angstrom
	- Equal to 0.1 nanometer
