- The medium used
	- E-Waste
- Short description of the work
	- Jason Mecier is an innovative artist that turns trash into treasure and this is one of those works. Jason used 20 pounds of electronic waste, compiled and collaged them together, to recreate the iconic portrait of Steve Jobs, done 2006 by Albert M. Watson.
- Personal reflection on the work
	- What I personally see in this work is that the tech giant Steve Jobs is someone who has pushed for greater electronic waste, even though he himself used those back in his day. The sleek white background full of technological advancements, arranged properly and primly. This contrasts the more colorful and vibrant portrait, of items represented what he used to create advancements and those that he laid to waste doing so.
