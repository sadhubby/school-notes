I. 
In my first initial glance, what I see are people that are groovy. Dancing, maybe a bit weird, but dancing. The lines suggest a human anatomy, the colors suggest vibrancy and upbeat liveliness. However, after careful a more careful observation, my opinion has changed. The lines are stiff and rigid. Even the curves are not gentle. The expression on the main object, expressionless, not suggestive of happiness or spontaneity. The colors are not simply vibrant additions but more of indicators of correctness and incorrectness. All of these contribute to the work that instead of seeing a spontaneous burst of creativity, it is a practiced set of instructions, some followed, some not. I do sincerely believe that I am suggested an art that portrays a circus performance, or that of a practice for a circus performance.

- The medium used
	- E-Waste
- Short description of the work
	- Jason Mecier is an innovative artist that turns trash into treasure and this is one of those works. Jason used 20 pounds of electronic waste, compiled and collaged them together, to recreate the iconic portrait of Steve Jobs, done 2006 by Albert M. Watson.
- Personal reflection on the work
	- What I personally see in this work is that the tech giant Steve Jobs is someone who has pushed for greater electronic waste, even though he himself used those back in his day. The sleek white background full of technological advancements, arranged properly and primly. This contrasts the more colorful and vibrant portrait, of items represented what he used to create advancements and those that he laid to waste doing so.
